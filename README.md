Gemini Truth Vision
Gemini Truth Vision is a powerful AI detection tool designed to identify AI-generated images and videos. It leverages advanced machine learning models to analyze content and determine its authenticity, helping to distinguish between human-made and synthetic media.

🚀 Features
AI Image Detection: Accurately identifies images generated by models like Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E.

Video Analysis: Scans video frames to detect synthetic manipulation or AI generation.

High Precision: Uses state-of-the-art detection algorithms (utilizing safetensors for efficient model loading).

Easy Integration: Simple Python API for integrating into existing workflows.

CLI Support: Run detection directly from the command line.

🛠️ Installation
To use Gemini Truth Vision, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

Bash

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Gemini-Truth-Vision.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Gemini-Truth-Vision

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
📖 Usage
Command Line Interface (CLI)
You can use Gemini Truth Vision directly from the terminal to scan files.

Bash

# Detect AI content in an image
python main.py --image path/to/image.jpg

# Detect AI content in a video
python main.py --video path/to/video.mp4
Python Implementation
Import Gemini Truth Vision into your Python scripts for programmatic detection.

Python

from stableguard import Detector 
# Note: Internal module name may remain 'stableguard' unless refactored

# Initialize the detector
model = Detector()

# Analyze an image
result = model.predict("assets/sample_image.jpg")

if result['is_ai_generated']:
    print(f"Gemini Truth Vision Detected AI: {result['confidence']}% confidence")
else:
    print("Gemini Truth Vision: Content appears to be real.")
📂 Supported Formats
Images: JPG, PNG, WEBP, TIFF

Videos: MP4, AVI, MOV
